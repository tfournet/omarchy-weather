# Detailed Weather

A single Omarchy bar pill that **replaces** the built-in `omarchy.weather`
widget. Click it for today's remaining-hour forecast and a ten-day outlook
(compact strip by default; optional mouse-spinnable orbit).
**Open radar** launches a saved radar website in your default browser.

Named to sit next to stock Weather, Weathering, and Weather Radar without
colliding. Plugin id stays `io.github.calebhat.weather`.

No API key. Location is the same file Omarchy already uses.

## Why this exists

Omarchy's stock weather pill shows current conditions and a short outlook.
[Weathering](https://github.com/howdyitskyle/weathering-omarchy-plugin) is a
richer forecast panel. [Weather Radar](https://github.com/eduardodallecort/omarchy-weather-radar)
is a separate radar pill.

This plugin is the stock header replacement: a richer forecast, peek at
another city without changing home, and **Open radar** to a website you
choose (RainViewer, NOAA, Windy, Weather Underground, or a custom https
URL). There is no in-panel radar map — public tile APIs no longer offer
one consistent past+future product without a paid key.

It is MIT-licensed work adapted from Weathering and Weather Radar plus the
stock weather contract. See [NOTICE.md](NOTICE.md).

## Features

### Bar pill

Intended to stand in for the built-in weather icon in the centre of the
bar (disable `omarchy.weather` so you only have one pill). The pill shows
a smaller current-condition glyph for your **saved home** location, even
while the panel is peeking at another city. With **Show temperature on the
bar** on, the current outside temperature sits next to the glyph in the
same **°C** / **°F** units as the panel (auto, metric, or imperial).

| Input | Action |
|-------|--------|
| Left-click | Open or close the panel |
| Middle-click | Refresh the forecast |
| Right-click | Notification from this panel's current reading |
| Escape (panel open) | Close |

### Forecast

Current temperature and condition, feels-like, wind, and precipitation
chance. New readings count smoothly into place; warming flashes amber with a
rising mark, while cooling flashes ice-blue with a falling mark. Below that:

- **Today** — remaining hours of the current local day (not a fixed six-cell
  strip). When only a few hours remain, their cards expand evenly across the
  full row with symmetric edges; scroll sideways when the day is long. The
  first cell is **NOW**. Each hour shows its chance of rain and the forecast
  amount (inches with imperial units, millimetres otherwise).
- **Metrics** — wind (speed and direction), humidity, pressure, UV, air
  quality (US AQI, PM2.5 / PM10), sunrise and sunset. Each block can be
  hidden in settings.
- **Ten-day forecast** — compact strip of today plus the next nine days
  (default), each with its forecast rain total. Settings → **Orbital forecast** swaps that for a mouse-spinnable
  orbit around a live detail hub. Drag or flick, scroll the wheel, click any
  day, or use Left/Right (also `h`/`l`). Depth, tilt, opacity, momentum, and a
  spring snap make the ring feel physical. The center and four detail cells
  update with condition, high/low, precipitation, UV, sunrise, and sunset.
  Auto-spin advances after 6.5 seconds idle and pauses under the pointer.
  Condition-reactive ambient color and a drifting ghost glyph follow the
  selected day; cards lean into velocity, rain becomes a liquid wave gauge,
  and thunderstorm days carry an urgent breathing edge. A soft energy core of
  phase-shifted radial rings breathes behind the selected condition, accelerating
  visually into the urgent palette for storms. Forecast loading uses an
  animated organic Canvas glyph rather than a static spinner. Refreshes and
  city changes sweep the old forecast away behind layered, condition-colored
  Bézier waves, then reveal the new sky in the direction of the last orbit
  gesture.

The orbit entrance and weather wipe run at 1.5× their original speed, keeping
the visual hit while getting the forecast under your eyes sooner.

Forecast-panel and bar-pill units follow `auto` (locale and country),
`metric`, or `imperial`. The bar temperature only shows when **Show
temperature on the bar** is on.

### Detail cards, moon and tides

Click an hourly card or a day (in the strip or the orbit) for its detail card;
click it again, click outside, or press Escape to close it. The day card shows
the moon (phase, illumination, moonrise and moonset, computed locally) and,
when a tide station is near, that day's highs and lows, with the station's name
and distance so you can judge it. Tide
predictions come from NOAA CO-OPS (US coasts and territories) or the Canadian
Hydrographic Service, using a station index shipped in the plugin
(`tide-stations.json`, regenerate with `scripts/build-tide-stations.py`). They
are fetched when the panel opens on the forecast (the line under the hourly cards uses them), at most once a day per station, and
cached in `~/.local/state/omarchy/detailed-weather-tides.json`. One setting,
`tides`, controls them: `auto` (the default) shows tides when the nearest
station is within 100 km of the forecast location, `on` always uses the nearest
station at any distance, and `off` never does. With `off`, or `auto` and no
station in range, nothing is requested, cached or drawn.

Under the hourly cards, when tides are active and the cached predictions include
an event after now, one line gives the next high or low, for example
`TIDE · Weeks Bay · Falling · Low 9:34 PM (0.0 ft)`: the station, Rising when
the next event is a high or Falling when it is a low, its time in the forecast's
own timezone (with the short weekday, `Low Tue 3:10 AM`, when it is not today
there) and its height in the chosen unit. With tides off, no events, or none
after now, there is no line and it takes no space.

### Theme colour

Weather icons, rain amounts, UV bands, the day card's high and low, and tide
highs and lows take their colour from the theme's own `colors.toml` names
(`yellow`, `blue`, `cyan`, `magenta`, `orange`, `green`, `red`, `muted`). A name
the theme lacks falls back to the accent tint, and every colour is moved toward
the foreground until it reads on the theme's background, so light themes stay
legible. Body text stays the foreground. The choices are in `Palette.js`.

### Open radar

**Open radar** on the forecast launches the saved site in your default
browser. Choose the site under **Settings** (RainViewer, NOAA, Windy,
Weather Underground, or Custom). Custom URLs must be `https://…`.
Optional `{lat}` and `{lon}` are filled from the city you are viewing.

### Settings

**Settings** (top-right on the forecast) opens units, 12- or 24-hour clocks,
the radar website, bar temperature, and storm alerts. **Done** (top-left on
Settings) returns to the forecast. Home location stays the pin on the forecast.

### Home location

Shared with stock Omarchy weather:
`~/.local/state/omarchy/settings/weather.json`, via
`omarchy-weather-location`. Click the **pin / city name** to search and
**save** a new home. Enter only accepts a city you picked from the list
(or the only match). Empty Enter cancels. The ✕ clears saved location
back to IP auto-detect. Changing home here also moves any other widget
that reads that file.

### Peek

The **search** icon next to the city name looks up another place **without
saving it**.

- Pick a geocoded suggestion (arrow or click). A typed name alone is not enough.
- Forecast, radar, and **Open radar** follow the peeked city
- The bar pill stays on home
- Storm alerts stay on home
- **Back to \<home\>** returns. Peek stays until you do that (closing the panel does not throw it away).

Use peek for “what’s the weather in Madison.” Use the pin to actually move
home.

### Storm alerts (off by default)

Optional. When on, a background check looks at the forecast around **home**
(not a peek) and notifies if rain or a storm is expected inside the alert
radius. Toggle from Settings.

Inside the United States the forecast is not trusted on its own. Open-Meteo
answers most places from a global model on a grid tens of kilometres wide, which
cannot resolve a thunderstorm — it spreads one across a cell and takes it back
an hour later. So the reading is weighed against your local National Weather
Service office, which forecasts on a 2.5 km grid and issues the watches and
warnings by hand:

| Your local office says | What happens to the forecast |
|---|---|
| A warning is in force | It outranks the forecast, in both directions — a storm the coarse model missed still alerts, under the warning's own name |
| Rain is likely (≥50%) | Passes through unchanged |
| Rain is possible (30–49%) | Capped below the alert threshold — the bar still shows it, nothing interrupts you |
| Rain is unlikely (<30%) | Dropped |

Anywhere without an NWS office — everywhere outside the US — the forecast is
used exactly as before. So is anywhere the service cannot be reached, or has not
answered in the last 45 minutes: a second opinion that is missing can decline to
help, but it can never silence an alert.

Still not a life-safety tool. It now tells you what your national weather
service is saying, which is not the same as being one.

## Install

```sh
omarchy plugin add https://github.com/calebhat/omarchy-weather.git --enable
omarchy plugin disable omarchy.weather
omarchy bar move io.github.calebhat.weather --section center
omarchy restart shell
```

`--enable` adds this widget; disable the built-in `omarchy.weather` pill so
you do not get two weather icons. Move this one to centre if it landed
elsewhere.

Do not enable this together with Weathering or Weather Radar in the same
bar slot unless you want two weather pills. Disable those if you are
switching.

## Configure

Settings live on the widget’s entry in `~/.config/omarchy/shell.json` (or
the bar settings form). `shell.json` hot-reloads on save.

| Key | Default | Meaning |
|-----|---------|---------|
| `unit` | `auto` | `auto` / `metric` / `imperial` |
| `refreshMinutes` | `15` | Forecast refresh, 5–120 |
| `showHourly` | `true` | Remaining hours for today |
| `showForecast` | `true` | Ten-day outlook |
| `showMetrics` | `true` | Wind / humidity / pressure / UV grid |
| `showSun` | `true` | Sunrise / sunset cell |
| `showAirQuality` | `true` | US AQI cell |
| `showFeelsLike` | `true` | Feels-like in the header |
| `showBarTemp` | `false` | Current temperature next to the bar glyph |
| `forecastOrbit` | `false` | Orbital ten-day forecast instead of the compact strip |
| `orbitAutoSpin` | `true` | Advance the day orbit after 6.5 seconds idle |
| `tides` | `auto` | `auto` (station within 100 km) / `on` (nearest, any distance) / `off` |
| `alertsEnabled` | `false` | Storm alerts for home |
| `alertRadiusKm` | `100` | How far around home to sample |
| `alertMinIntensity` | `Heavy` | `Light` / `Moderate` / `Heavy` / `Severe` |
| `radarSite` | `RainViewer` | Website Open radar launches |
| `radarUrl` | (empty) | Custom https URL when `radarSite` is Custom |
| `timeFormat` | `24` | `12` or `24` hour clocks |

## Remove

```sh
omarchy plugin remove io.github.calebhat.weather
```

The built-in weather widget comes back. `weather.json` is left alone.

## Data

| Source | Used for |
|--------|----------|
| Open-Meteo | Current, hourly, daily, air quality, city search |
| tidesandcurrents.noaa.gov (NOAA CO-OPS) | US only, when tides are active: high/low tide predictions |
| api-iwls.dfo-mpo.gc.ca (Canadian Hydrographic Service) | Canada only, when tides are active: high/low tide predictions |
| api.weather.gov (NWS) | US only, storm alerts only: watches and warnings in force, and the local office's probability of precipitation |
| wttr.in | IP auto-detect when no home coordinates are stored |
| RainViewer / NOAA / Windy / WU | Opened in the browser by Open radar (user's saved site) |

## Security

Plugins run unsandboxed inside `omarchy-shell`. This one:

- Fetches the HTTPS endpoints above
- Writes home location only through `omarchy-weather-location` (argv, no
  shell). Peek never writes that file
- Opens the browser only with `omarchy-launch-browser` and an `https://`
  URL from the saved radar site (custom URLs are sanitized: https only, no
  `javascript:` / `data:` / `file:`)
- Invokes every process as an argv array (`curl`,
  `omarchy-notification-send`, `omarchy-weather-location`). No `bash -c`,
  no `$(…)`, no pipe-to-shell
- Caps JSON bodies (`curl --max-filesize` plus a length check before parse:
  1 MiB forecast, 4 KiB place name)

Right-click on the pill sends a notification built from this panel's current
reading.

## License and external dependencies

MIT — [LICENSE](LICENSE) and [NOTICE.md](NOTICE.md).

No extra packages and no pip. No sudo or pkexec is required. Runtime
network only: Open-Meteo, api.weather.gov (US locations, and only while storm
alerts are on), wttr.in, and the user-chosen radar website (opened in the
default browser). Location is written through `omarchy-weather-location`.

With storm alerts off — the default — api.weather.gov is never contacted.

State written: `~/.local/state/omarchy/detailed-weather-alert.json`, holding
which alert level you were last told about, so a plugin reload does not announce
the same storm twice. It records a level, a place and a time, and nothing else.
